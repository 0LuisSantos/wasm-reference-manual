# WebAssembly Reference Manual README.md

This directory contains
[WebAssembly.md](https://github.com/sunfishcode/wasm-reference-manual/tree/master/WebAssembly.md),
a human-readable reference manual document written in Github-Flavored Markdown.

Github-flavored Markdown is almost just powerful enough for this use case; it
lacks are tables of contents and convenient term definitions, however I hope the
advantages in ease of use and collaboration make up or that.

It is a work in progress known to be particularly "incomplet and inkorrect" at
this time, however corrections and contributions are welcome.
