# WebAssembly Reference Manual README.md

This directory contains
[WebAssembly.md](https://github.com/sunfishcode/wasm-reference-manual/tree/master/WebAssembly.md),
a human-readable reference manual document written in Github-Flavored Markdown.

Github-flavored Markdown is almost just powerful enough for this use case; the
main things it lacks are automatic tables of contents and convenient term
definitions, however the advantages in ease of use and collaboration at least
partly make up for that.

Known deficiencies are marked with TODO comments. Corrections and contributions
are welcome!
